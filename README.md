<h1>Welcome</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb listings in Toronto using descriptive and inferential statistical analysis techniques. The analysis was conducted as part of the "Math for Data Analytics" class.</p>
<p>The dataset used for this analysis is stored in <code>datasetExploration.xlsx</code>. It includes original and cleaned datasets, a data dictionary, pivot tables, graphs, and statistical analysis. Additionally, the final report summarizing the findings can be found in <code>finalReport.docx</code>.</p>

<h2>Data Source</h2>
<p>The dataset was sourced from <a href="https://insideairbnb.com/">Inside Airbnb</a> and contains detailed information about accommodations in Toronto as of January 8th, 2024.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>This project aims to leverage expertise in the travel and tourism industry to extract meaningful insights and analyze the implications of the 5-star review system in the digital space.</p>

<h2>Techniques Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Log normalization</li>
    <li>Univariate descriptive statistics</li>
    <li>Risk Ratio/Odds Ratio</li>
    <li>Chi-Square Test</li>
    <li>ANOVA</li>
    <li>Correlation</li>
    <li>Linear regression</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Review Score Variance:</strong> Listings with fewer than 20 reviews showed significant variance in review scores, skewing results. Excluding these listings improved the accuracy of guest satisfaction analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Superhost Performance:</strong> Superhosts consistently achieved higher ratings across all categories, highlighting their status as indicators of quality listings.</li>
    <li><strong>Impact of Superhost Status:</strong> Superhost status significantly influences review scores, particularly in categories like accuracy, cleanliness, and communication.</li>
    <li><strong>Response Times and Communication Scores:</strong> Faster response times correlate with higher communication scores, underscoring the importance of responsiveness.</li>
    <li><strong>Neighborhood Influence:</strong> Choice of neighborhood significantly affects Airbnb ratings, emphasizing the role of location in guest satisfaction.</li>
    <li><strong>Correlations Among Review Categories:</strong> Positive correlations exist among accuracy, cleanliness, communication, value, and overall rating scores, indicating interconnected guest experiences.</li>
    <li><strong>Challenges in Predictive Modeling:</strong> Linear regression may not accurately predict overall review scores due to complex relationships among review categories.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Challenges with Scalar Data:</strong> 5-star reviews present challenges in statistical analysis due to grade inflation.</li>
    <li><strong>Excel's Limitations:</strong> Issues with Excel's handling of large numbers were encountered during data import, though they did not impact the analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Query for Data Cleaning:</strong> Power Query offers robust data cleaning capabilities, enhancing transparency and reproducibility.</li>
    <li><strong>The Null Hypothesis in Statistical Analysis:</strong> Emphasizing the null hypothesis ensures rigor and reliability in drawing conclusions from data.</li>
