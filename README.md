<h1>Welcome</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb listings in Toronto using descriptive and inferential statistical analysis techniques. The analysis was conducted as part of the "Math for Data Analytics" class.</p>
<p>The dataset used for this analysis is stored in <code>datasetExploration.xlsx</code>. It includes original and cleaned datasets, a data dictionary, pivot tables, graphs, and statistical analysis. Additionally, the final report summarizing the findings can be found in <code>finalReport.docx</code>.</p>

<h2>Data Source</h2>
<p>The dataset was sourced from <a href="https://insideairbnb.com/">Inside Airbnb</a> and contains detailed information about accommodations in Toronto as of January 8th, 2024.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>This project aims to leverage my previous experience working in the travel and tourism industry to extract meaningful insights from the statistical tests applied on this dataset.</p>

<h2>Techniques Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Log normalization</li>
    <li>Univariate descriptive statistics</li>
    <li>Risk Ratio/Odds Ratio</li>
    <li>Chi-Square Test</li>
    <li>ANOVA</li>
    <li>Correlation</li>
    <li>Linear regression</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Challenges with Scalar Data:</strong> 5-star reviews present challenges in statistical analysis due to grade inflation. This can skew the distribution, making traditional statistical methods assuming normality less reliable.</li>
    <li><strong>Excel's Limitations:</strong> Issues with Excel's handling of large numbers were encountered during data import, though they did not impact the analysis. This occurs because Excel only stores up to 15 significant digits in a number, converting any digits beyond the fifteenth place to zeros.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Query for Data Cleaning:</strong> If I could change something on my assignment, would be the inclusion of Power Query. Power Query offers a robust way to track changes and steps taken to modify the dataset, providing a transparent and reproducible data cleaning process. </li>
    <li><strong>The Null Hypothesis in Statistical Analysis:</strong> Focusing on the null hypothesis in statistical analysis is crucial because it ensures rigor and reliability in drawing conclusions from data. It also helps to reduce the amount of bias and guards against premature conclusions.</li>
